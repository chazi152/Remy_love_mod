End conditions

1. Wren finishes early
   estate_cards_end: "wren_finished_early" (or gets replaced with "oral")
   Desc: The PC has out-endured Wren, so technically Wren finished first
   Bets: allowed to take the pot
   End Location: Estate
   Clothes: oral for towel (if naked)
   Reason: while Wren didn't get to take PC, PC also hasn't gotten all they wanted from Wren, so it's really a tie. Wren does end up better off, so technically he'd still be dominant enough to demand oral for towel, rather than demanding oral for clothes buy-back

2. Wren finishes with PC
   estate_cards_end: "sex" ("oral" setter is ignored), or "sex_safe" ("oral" can replace it)
   Desc: The PC has lost, and Wren took his reward. PC lost
   Bets: allowed to take the pot
   End Location: Estate
   Clothes: oral for towel (if naked)
   Reason: Wren completely dominated PC, so definitely only oral for towel. It does have a variation where PC can have a chastity (so no sex), but we consider this to still be end 2

3. PC cheats, ends up being forgiven
   estate_cards_end: "cheat_moor"
   Desc: The PC was caught cheating, so it's a disqualification. Thrown into the moor
   Bets: pot confiscated
   End Location: Moor
   Clothes: none
   Reason: getitng caught cheating is considered a complete loss

4. PC cheats, ends up surrendering
   estate_cards_end: "cheat_remy"
   Desc: The PC was caught cheating, so it's a disqualification. Given to Remy. Can also be reached by failing plead (failed 3) and surrendering, or not trying to plead and surrendering
   Bets: pot confiscated
   End Location: Remy
   Clothes: none
   Reason: getitng caught cheating is considered a complete loss

5. PC cheats, ends up successfully running
   estate_cards_end: "cheat_run"
   Desc: The PC was caught cheating, disqualification. Can also be reached by failing plead (failed 3) and running, or not trying to plead and surrendering
   (???) Bets: pot confiscated, but perhaps we should let the player try and steal the pot for a much lower escape chance
   End Location: Estate
   Clothes: none
   Reason: obviously, because we ran, no option to get clothes/a towel back

6. PC cheats, ends up running, but fails
   estate_cards_end: "cheat_remy"
   Desc: The PC was caught cheating, disqualification. Can also be reached by failing plead (failed 3) and running, or not trying to plead and surrendering. Got caught, given to Remy.
   Bets: pot confiscated
   End Location: Remy
   Clothes: none
   Reason: obviously, because we ran and got caught, no option to get clothes/a towel back

7. PC runs after loss, ends up successfully running
   estate_cards_end: "run"
   Desc: not as bad as cheating, PC lost and ran
   (???) Bets: pot confiscated, but perhaps we should let the player try and steal the pot for a much lower escape chance
   End Location: Estate
   Clothes: none

8. PC runs after loss, ends up getting caught
   estate_cards_end: "run"
   Desc: not as bad as cheating, PC lost and tried runing, got caught, thrown into moor
   Bets: pot confiscated
   End Location: Moor
   Clothes: none

9. PC leaves early
   estate_cards_end: "naked" or "left_early"
   Desc: The PC has left early.
   Bets: allowed to take pot
   End Location: Estate
   Clothes: oral for towel (if naked)
   Reason: Wren is diasppoitned that PC is leaving the game essentially in the middle of it (with no one having won). Too annoyed to let the player get the clothes back


10. (todo) PC declares victory
   estate_cards_end: "pc_won" (or gets replaced by "pc_won_and_oral")
   Desc: The PC gets all favors they needed from Wren, and declares that they don't need anything else. Considered a win because Wren has exhasuted his usefulness and PC hasn't. PC can either rebuy the clothes after satisfying the goons, or leave
   Bets: allowed to take the pot
   End Location: Estate
   Clothes: allowed to buy back (all states)
   Reason: Wren realizes they've done a ton of favours already and didn't get much from you, so they must feel defeated enough to let you take the clothes you've lost back




For each of these outcomes, we need to call <<card_pot_confiscated>> right after the PC abandons the pot (if the bets are confiscated) or <<card_pot_collected>> right before the player leaves the table (if the player collects the bet)
Each also calls <<estate_cards_finish>> and calls <<endevent>> and some set $estate_cards_end
Some also call <<estate_end>> if they kick the player directly into the moor/remy's farm

		the reason I haven't done that is because, if the state is "ride" and the player loses - the moor option is not available to then

		so this means the consequence of losing before the ride state is, at worst, being given to remy or being sent to the moor,

		otherwise players could intentionally get caught cheating in this phase in a lost hand and avoid the consequences, but pehraps that
