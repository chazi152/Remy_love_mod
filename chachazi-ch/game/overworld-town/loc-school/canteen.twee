				You hear a gasp from one of the tables. Turning in the direction of the sound, you spot Robin at a packed table, mouth agape.

				<<if $robinReunionScene is "dungeon">>
					"I don't believe it!" <<he>> squeals before burying <<himself>> in your chest. "I-I thought you were gone forever!"

				<<else>>
					"I don't believe it!" <<he>> squeals before burying <<himself>> in your chest. "I thought you'd never escape!"

						"I-I was worried about you too," <<nnpc_he "Kylar">> says. "I lost track of you."<<stress 3>><<gstress>>

							"Will you stop that?" <<he>> demands, causing Kylar to jolt in surprise.
							"You're being a bother. <<pShes>> clearly under a lot of stress right now, so please, either behave yourself or leave my <<if $robinromance is 1>><<girl>><</if>>friend alone!"
							<br>
							Robin huffs as <<he>> finishes, breathing heavily. Kylar looks astonished.
							<<nnpc_He "Kylar">> gapes at Robin for a moment, then sticks <<nnpc_his "Kylar">> tongue out and scurries back to <<nnpc_his "Kylar">> table.
							<br><br>
							Eventually, Robin starts to calm down. <<He>> looks embarrassed.
							"S-sorry, that was rude," <<he>> mumbles. "I should apologise to <<nnpc_him "Kylar">>."
							<<He>> glances towards Kylar's table, where <<nnpc_he "Kylar">> stabs <<nnpc_his "Kylar">> food with more resentment than usual.
							"M-maybe later, though."
							<br>
							<<He>> gives you a nervous smile and a wave as <<he>> returns to <<his>> table.
						<<else>>
							Robin doesn't seem to notice. If <<he>> does, <<hes>> too worried about you to care.
							<br><br>
							After a while, the two finish fussing over you and return to their respective tables.

						You tell Robin that you're fine. <<He>> nods and gives you one last squeeze, then walks back to <<his>> table.

					<<Hes>> always looked up to you, despite being about the same age.
					<<He>> runs towards you and fails to slow down in time, colliding with you and almost spilling <<his>> food tray.
					You hold <<his>> arm to steady <<him>>. "Thanks," <<he>> says, looking embarrassed though still smiling.

					"I didn't see you this morning. Remember, <span class="gold">you can visit me in my room at home</span> anytime you want.
					I've been waiting to show you something. I'm so excited!"
