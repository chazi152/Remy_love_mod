With your head covered by a hood and your arms bound behind your back, you _andRobin are led down a flight of stairs and along a tunnel.
You trip a couple of times, prompting Bailey to drag you back to your feet and slap your face in anger.

	After journeying for some time you hear another set of footsteps.
	<<if _robinIsPresent>>
		"Hand them over," says a <<personsimple>>'s voice.
		<br><br>

		"Money first," responds Bailey. "Will I get them back?"
		<br><br>

		"You won't want them when we're done."
		<br><br>
	<<else>>
		"Hand <<phim>> over," says a <<personsimple>>'s voice.

		"Money first," responds Bailey. "Will I get <<phim>> back?"
		<br><br>

		"You won't want <<phim>> when we're done."
		<br><br>
	<</if>>

	You hear a rustle of paper before being dragged further along the tunnel.

		You journey for some time until you feel solid concrete beneath your feet. Another set of footsteps approach.
		You think you hear the rustle of an officer's belt.
		<br><br>

		"Hand the suspect over," a voice commands.
		<br><br>

		"Cash first. No time behind bars." Bailey's anger is very apparent. "I want <<nnpc_him "Robin">> back in one piece."
		<br><br>

		"Very well. We have other plans for this one anyway." You hear what sounds like the rustling of cash.
		<br><br>

		Robin begins to cry. "I-I didn't do anything! Please, don't!" <<nnpc_His "Robin">> voice trails off. Bailey tugs you elsewhere.

		You continue for a while longer,
	<<else>>
		You journey for some time,
	<</if>>
	until you hear the sound of engines up ahead. The sound echoes, becoming closer, until you hear it all around you.
	"Good stock," says an unfamiliar voice. "Would make a fine breeder."
	<br>
	"The money," Bailey responds, impatient.
	<br>
	"Ah. Here." There's a rustle to one side, then someone tugs on your leash, pulling you forward.
	<br>
	"A pleasure," Bailey says, already walking away.
	<br><br>

	"Watch the step," says the unfamiliar voice. Whatever you've stepped onto is rumbling. "Sit."
	You fumble around your knees, and find what feels like a bench.
	You sit, then hear the slam of doors, and a few moment later you lurch as the floor moves beneath you. You're in a vehicle.

	<<else>>
		After journeying for some time you emerge outside.
	<</if>>
	You hear wind rustling through leaves.
	Bailey lifts you and hooks your bindings on something behind you, leaving you suspended in the air.
	"Don't go anywhere, you'll be picked up shortly," <<he>> says. You hear <<him>> walk away, leaving you alone.

	<<else>>
		"No, I'm just taking my <<girl>> for a walk,"
	<</if>>
	says Bailey, <<person1>><<his>> temper barely concealed beneath the sarcasm.
	"Just give me the cash. And I want them back in one piece, you're not paying enough..."

		Robin's voice suddenly becomes muffled, and to your alarm, you hear <<nnpc_him "Robin">> fall to the ground soon after.
		<br><br>
	<</if>>
	A moment later, you feel someone press something against your mouth, and your consciousness fades. <<arousal 6000>><<gggarousal>>
