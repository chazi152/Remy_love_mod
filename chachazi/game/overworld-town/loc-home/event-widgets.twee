		You hear excited voices. Several orphans cluster around the window. It's snowing.
		<br><br>
		"I want to make a snowman."
		<br>
		"There's not enough snow."
		<br>
		"There will be!"
		<br>
		"Just make sure you wrap up warm."
		<br><br>
		A <<person2>><<person>> runs for the main doors, and throws them open. <<His>> smile vanishes. Bailey strides in, and the doors slam shut.<<lhope>><<hope -1>>

		You overhear two orphans.

		"What do you think I'll get for Christmas?" A <<person1>><<person>> asks, thumbing a small object in <<his>> hand.
		<br>
		"Bailey lets us decorate," a <<person2>><<person>> responds. "But gifts? Maybe Father Christmas will bring us something, huh?" <<He>> nudges the <<person1>><<person>>, who doesn't look convinced.

		<i>Some new clothes would go a long way for a lot of residents. The shopping centre should do. You could pick up something for Robin at the forest shop or shopping centre as well.</i>
