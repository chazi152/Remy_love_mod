		You curl up on the soft straw, and fall asleep within moments.
	<<elseif $cow gte 4 or $wolfgirl gte 4 or $cat gte 4 or $fox gte 4>>
		You curl up on the straw. This isn't so bad. You're awoken by a heavy rattling.
	<<elseif $cow gte 3 or $wolfgirl gte 3 or $cat gte 3 or $fox gte 3>>
		You curl up on the straw and try to make the best of it. You're awoken by a heavy rattling.

		You gather more straw to make your bed softer. It helps, a little. Your sleep is broken by a heavy rattling.
	<<elseif $cow gte 1 or $wolfgirl gte 1 or $cat gte 1 or $fox gte 1>>
		You lie down on the straw. It's little better than just sleeping on the floor. You don't think you'll ever be able to sleep here, but the next thing you know you're being woken by a heavy rattling.
	<<else>>
		You sit and lean against the wall, ignoring the pile of straw. You're not an animal. It takes a while to fall asleep. You're awoken by a heavy rattling.

:: Livestock Eden Escape
<<effects>>
You run with Eden across the open moor, but soon hear the thundering of hooves behind you. You glance over your shoulder and see Remy riding a <<livestock_horse>>. <<nnpc_He "Remy">>'s approaching fast.
<br><br>
Eden unslings <<his>> rifle, and takes aim. <<He>> fires a shot at the <<livestock_horse>>'s feet. It rears back in fear and falls to the ground, taking Remy with it.
<br><br>
Seizing the chance, you and Eden dash across the fields. You crest a hill. The forest lies beyond.

The centaur carries you over fields and hills, until coming to a stop at a crest dotted with trees. You see the forest and town beneath you.

"That's as far as I can go," the centaur says, lifting you off its back. "I'm gonna get a bollicking at the farm, but my family is there." <<He>> places you on the ground.

The horse carries you over fields and hills, until coming to a stop at a crest dotted with trees. You see the forest and town beneath you.
<br><br>
The horse will go no further. You climb from its back. It rubs its head against you, and you pet it back.

Satisfied, it turns back toward the farm. It dashes forward, disappearing behind the hill.
