The midwife places a mask over your face. You feel your consciousness fade. Several other figures appear around you, their forms ablur.

	You feel your insides drop as you stand, but <<he>> assures you that's normal.
	<br><br>

	Despite the pain, you feel a lot more comfortable walking than you did before the birth. You'd forgotten how easy it is to move without people inside you.

	You get walking again quite easily. It's a little awkward, but the transition isn't as bad as it used to be. It's still easier to move around when there isn't another human inside you.

	You stand up without a hitch. There's hardly any difference in feeling anymore, although you do feel much more nimble.

	<<He>> looks impressed at your mobility, only keeping an arm around you for stability. "I don't see many people get back up that quickly. You must be hardy!"
